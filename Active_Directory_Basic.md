# Active Directory Basics
Active Directory is the directory service for Windows Domain Networks. It is used by many of today's top companies and is a vital skill to comprehend when attacking Windows.
## Physical Active Directory
The physical Active Directory is the servers and machines on-premise, these can be anything from domain controllers and storage servers to domain user machines; everything needed for an Active Directory environment besides the software.
### Domain Controllers
﻿A domain controller is a Windows server that has Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) installed and has been promoted to a domain controller in the forest. Domain controllers are the center of Active Directory -- they control the rest of the domain. I will outline the tasks of a domain controller below:
-   holds the AD DS data store
-   handles authentication and authorization services
-   replicate updates from other domain controllers in the forest
-   Allows admin access to manage domain resources


The Active Directory Data Store holds the databases and processes needed to store and manage directory information such as users, groups, and services. Below is an outline of some of the contents and characteristics of the AD DS:

-   Contains the **NTDS.dit** - a database that contains all of the information of an Active Directory domain controller as well as password hashes for domain users
-   Stored by default in %SystemRoot%\NTDS
-   accessible only by the domain controller

## The forest
The forest is what defines everything; it is the container that holds all of the other bits and pieces of the network together -- without the forest all of the other trees and domains would not be able to interact. The one thing to note when thinking of the forest is to not think of it too literally -- it is a physical thing just as much as it is a figurative thing. When we say "forest", it is only a way of describing the connection created between these trees and domains by the network.
The Forest consists of these parts which we will go into farther detail with later:

-   Trees - A hierarchy of domains in Active Directory Domain Services
-   Domains - Used to group and manage objects
-   Organizational Units (OUs) - Containers for groups, computers, users, printers and other OUs
-   Trusts - Allows users to access resources in other domains
-   Objects - users, groups, printers, computers, shares
-   Domain Services - DNS Server, LLMNR, IPv6
-   Domain Schema - Rules for object creation

## Users & Groups
The users and groups that are inside of an Active Directory are up to you; when you create a domain controller it comes with default groups and two default users: Administrator and guest.
### Users
﻿There are four main types of users you'll find in an Active Directory network; however, there can be more depending on how a company manages the permissions of its users. The four types of users are:

-   Domain Admins - This is the big boss: they control the domains and are the only ones with access to the domain controller.
-   Service Accounts (Can be Domain Admins) - These are for the most part never used except for service maintenance, they are required by Windows for services such as SQL to pair a service with a service account
-   Local Administrators - These users can make changes to local machines as an administrator and may even be able to control other normal users, but they cannot access the domain controller
-   Domain Users - These are your everyday users. They can log in on the machines they have the authorization to access and may have local administrator rights to machines depending on the organization.

### Groups
Groups make it easier to give permissions to users and objects by organizing them into groups with specified permissions. There are two overarching types of Active Directory groups:

-   Security Groups - These groups are used to specify permissions for a large number of users
-   Distribution Groups - These groups are used to specify email distribution lists. As an attacker these groups are less beneficial to us but can still be beneficial in enumeration

## Trust and Policies
**Trusts** are a mechanism in place for users in the network to gain access to other resources in the domain. For the most part, trusts outline the way that the domains inside of a forest communicate to each other, in some environments trusts can be extended out to external domains and even forests in some cases.
There are two types of trusts that determine how the domains communicate. 

-   Directional - The direction of the trust flows from a trusting domain to a trusted domain
-   Transitive - The trust relationship expands beyond just two domains to include other trusted domains

The type of trusts put in place determines how the domains and trees in a forest are able to communicate and send data to and from each other when attacking an Active Directory environment you can sometimes abuse these trusts in order to move laterally throughout the network.

**Policies** are a very big part of Active Directory, they dictate how the server operates and what rules it will and will not follow. You can think of domain policies like domain groups, except instead of permissions they contain rules, and instead of only applying to a group of users, the policies apply to a domain as a whole. They simply act as a rulebook for Active Directory that a domain admin can modify and alter as they deem necessary to keep the network running smoothly and securely.

 Along with the very long list of default domain policies, domain admins can choose to add in their own policies not already on the domain controller, for example: if you wanted to disable windows defender across all machines on the domain you could create a new group policy object to disable Windows Defender. The options for domain policies are almost endless and are a big factor for attackers when enumerating an Active Directory network. Those are just a few of the many policies that are default or you can create in an Active Directory environment:

-   Disable Windows Defender - Disables windows defender across all machine on the domain
-   Digitally Sign Communication (Always) - Can disable or enable SMB signing on the domain controller

# Active Directory Domain Services  & authentication
The Active Directory domain services are the core functions of an Active Directory network; they allow for management of the domain, security certificates, LDAPs, and much more. This is how the domain controller decides what it wants to do and what services it wants to provide for the domain.

**Domain Services** are exactly what they sound like. They are services that the domain controller provides to the rest of the domain or tree. There is a wide range of various services that can be added to a domain controller; however, in this room we'll only be going over the default services that come when you set up a Windows server as a domain controller. Outlined below are the default domain services:

-   LDAP - Lightweight Directory Access Protocol; provides communication between applications and directory services
-   Certificate Services - allows the domain controller to create, validate, and revoke public key certificates
-   DNS, LLMNR, NBT-NS - Domain Name Services for identifying IP hostnames

The most important part of Active Directory -- as well as the most vulnerable part of Active Directory -- is the authentication protocols set in place. There are two main types of authentication in place for Active Directory: NTLM and Kerberos.
-   Kerberos - The default authentication service for Active Directory uses ticket-granting tickets and service tickets to authenticate users and give users access to other resources across the domain.
-   NTLM - default Windows authentication protocol uses an encrypted challenge/response protocol

The Active Directory domain services are the main access point for attackers and contain some of the most vulnerable protocols for Active Directory.

## AD in the cloud
The most notable AD cloud provider is Azure AD. Its default settings are much more secure than an on-premise physical Active Directory network; however, the cloud AD may still have vulnerabilities in it.
### Azure
﻿Azure acts as the middle man between your physical Active Directory and your users' sign on. This allows for a more secure transaction between domains, making a lot of Active Directory attacks ineffective.
﻿Comparison with a physical Active Directory environment:
﻿
|**Windows Server AD**| **Azure AD** |
|--|--|
| LDAP |Rest APIs  |
| NTLM |OAuth/SAML  |
| Kerberos |OpenID  |
| OU Tree |Flat Structure  |
| Domains and Forests |Tenants  |
| Trusts |Guests  |
