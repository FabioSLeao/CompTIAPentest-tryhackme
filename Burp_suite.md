# Burp Suite Overview
## Components

 - **Proxy** : What allows us to funnel traffic through Burp Suite for further analysis.
 - **Target** : Create a effectively  site map of the application we are testing.
 - **Intruder** : For everything from field fuzzing to credential stuffing and more.
-   **Repeater** : Allows us to 'repeat' requests that have previously been made with or without modification. Often used in a precursor step to fuzzing with the aforementioned Intruder.
-  **Sequencer** : Analyzes the 'randomness' present in parts of the web app which are intended to be unpredictable. This is commonly used for testing session cookies
-   **Decoder** : As the name suggests, Decoder is a tool that allows us to perform various transforms on pieces of data. These transforms vary from decoding/encoding to various bases or URL encoding.
-   **Comparer** : Comparer as you might have guessed is a tool we can use to compare different responses or other pieces of data such as site maps or proxy histories (awesome for access control issue testing). This is very similar to the Linux tool diff.
-   **Extender** : Similar to adding mods to a game like Minecraft, Extender allows us to add components such as tool integrations, additional scan definitions, and more!
-   **Scanner (Pro only)** : Automated web vulnerability scanner that can highlight areas of the application for further manual investigation or possible exploitation with another section of Burp. This feature, while not in the community edition of Burp Suite, is still a key facet of performing a web application test.

### Proxy tool
By default,  after the certification, burp will be set to 'intercept' our traffic. That means:
1. Requests will by default require our authorization to be sent.

2. We can modify our requests in-line similar to what you might see in a man-in-the-middle attack and then send them on.

3. We can also drop requests we don't want to be sent. This can be useful to see the request attempt after clicking a button or performing another action on the website.

4. And last but not least, we can send these requests to other tools such as Repeater and Intruder for modification and manipulation to induce vulnerabilities.

In **options** we can set custom rules for the interceptions of client requests. One setting very useful is:

| Operator | Match type | Relationship | Condition
|--------|----------|------|------
|AND|URL | Is in target scope| 

### Target Tool
The Target tab in Burp allows us to perform arguably some of the most important parts of a web application penetration test: defining our scope, viewing a site map, and specifying our issue definitions.
Right click on the site of interest will trigger a pop up asking if you want to stop sending out of scope sites to site-map.

### Repeater Tool
Repeater allows us to repeat requests we've already made. These requests can either be reissued as-is or with modifications.
### Intruder Tool
Some common uses of the intruder are as follows:
- Enumerating identifiers such as usernames, cycling through predictable session/password recovery tokens, and attempting simple password guessing  
- Harvesting useful data from user profiles or other pages of interest via grepping our responses  
- Fuzzing for vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and file path traversal


To accomplish these various use cases, Intruder has four different attack types:  

1. **Sniper:** The most popular attack type, this cycles through our selected positions, putting the next available payload (item from our wordlist) in each position in turn. This uses only one set of payloads (one wordlist).

2. **Battering Ram:** Similar to Sniper, Battering Ram uses only one set of payloads. Unlike Sniper, Battering Ram puts every payload into every selected position. Think about how a battering ram makes contact across a large surface with a single surface, hence the name battering ram for this attack type.

3. **Pitchfork:** The Pitchfork attack type allows us to use multiple payload sets (one per position selected) and iterate through both payload sets _simultaneously_. For example, if we selected two positions (say a username field and a password field), we can provide a username and password payload list. Intruder will then cycle through the combinations of usernames and passwords, resulting in a total number of combinations equalling the smallest payload set provided.

4. **Cluster Bomb:** The Cluster Bomb attack type allows us to use multiple payload sets  (one per position selected) and iterate through all combinations of the payload lists we provide. For example, if we selected two positions (say a username field and a password field), we can provide a username and password payload list. Intruder will then cycle through the combinations of usernames and passwords, resulting in a total number of combinations equalling usernames x passwords.  _Do note, this can get pretty lengthy if you are using the community edition of Burp.

Important: By default, the payload of intruder is automatic URL-encoded for safe transmission.

### Sequencer tool
Burp's Sequencer,  is a tool for analyzing the quality of randomness in an application's sessions tokens and other important data items that are otherwise intended to be unpredictable. Some commonly analyzed items include:
- Session tokens  
- Anti-CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) tokens  
- Password reset tokens (sent with password resets that in theory uniquely tie users with their password reset requests)
### Decoder tool
Decoder is a tool that allows us to perform various transforms on pieces of data. These transforms vary from decoding/encoding to various bases or URL encoding. We chain these transforms together and Decoder will automatically spawn an additional tier each time we select a decoder, encoder, or hash. Comparable with [cyberchef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/)
### Comparer tool
Some interesting uses for comparer:
- When looking for username enumeration conditions, you can compare responses to failed logins using valid and invalid usernames, looking for subtle differences in responses. 
- This is also sometimes useful for when enumerating password recovery forms or another similar recovery/account access mechanism.

- When an Intruder attack has resulted in some very large responses with different lengths than the base response, you can compare these to quickly see where the differences lie.

- When comparing the site maps or Proxy history entries generated by different types of users, you can compare pairs of similar requests to see where the differences lie that give rise to different application behavior. This may reveal possible access control issues in the application wherein lower privileged users can access pages they really shouldn't be able to.

- When testing for blind SQL injection bugs using Boolean condition injection and other similar tests, you can compare two responses to see whether injecting different conditions has resulted in a relevant difference in responses.

### Extender tool
Extender allows us to add components such as tool integrations, additional scan definitions, and more! Here are some of the most popular extensions I suggest checking out (not all of these are free but I suggest looking into them all the same):  

-   [Logger++](https://portswigger.net/bappstore/470b7057b86f41c396a97903377f3d81) - Adds enhanced logging to all requests and responses from all Burp Suite tools, enable this one before you need it ;)
-   [Request Smuggler](https://portswigger.net/bappstore/aaaa60ef945341e8a450217a54a11646) - A relatively new extension, this allows you to attempt to smuggle requests to backend servers. See this talk by James Kettle for more details: [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_A04msdplXs)
-   [Autorize](https://portswigger.net/bappstore/f9bbac8c4acf4aefa4d7dc92a991af2f) - Useful for authentication testing in web app tests. These tests typically revolve around navigating to restricted pages or issuing restricted GET requests with the session cookies of low-privileged users
-   [Burp Teams Server](https://github.com/Static-Flow/BurpSuite-Team-Extension) - Allows for collaboration on a Burp project amongst team members. Project details are shared in a chatroom-like format
-   [Retire.js](https://portswigger.net/bappstore/36238b534a78494db9bf2d03f112265c) - Adds scanner checks for outdated JavaScript libraries that contain vulnerabilities, this is a premium extension
-   [J2EEScan](https://portswigger.net/bappstore/7ec6d429fed04cdcb6243d8ba7358880) - Adds scanner test coverage for J2EE (java platform for web development) applications, this is a premium extension
-   [Request Timer](https://portswigger.net/bappstore/56675bcf2a804d3096465b2868ec1d65) - Captures response times for requests made by all Burp tools, useful for discovering timing attack vectors

*A prerequisite for many of the extensions offered for Burp, we'll walk through the installation of Jython, the Java implementation of Python.*
