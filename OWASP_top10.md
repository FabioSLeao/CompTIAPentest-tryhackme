# OWASP Top Ten
## Injection
Injection flaws occur because user controlled input is interpreted as actual commands or parameters by the application. Injection attacks depend on what technologies are being used and how exactly the input is interpreted by these technologies. Some common examples include:

-   SQL Injection: This occurs when user controlled input is passed to SQL queries. As a result, an attacker can pass in SQL queries to manipulate the outcome of such queries.
-   Command Injection: This occurs when user input is passed to system commands. As a result, an attacker is able to execute arbitrary system commands on application servers.

If an attacker is able to successfully pass input that is interpreted correctly, they would be able to do the following:

-   Access, Modify and Delete information in a database when this input is passed into database queries. This would mean that an attacker can steal sensitive information such as personal details and credentials.
-   Execute Arbitrary system commands on a server that would allow an attacker to gain access to users’ systems. This would enable them to steal sensitive data and carry out more attacks against infrastructure linked to the server on which the command is executed.

The main defence for preventing injection attacks is ensuring that user controlled input is not interpreted as queries or commands. There are different ways of doing this:

-   Using an allow list: when input is sent to the server, this input is compared to a list of safe input or characters. If the input is marked as safe, then it is processed. Otherwise, it is rejected and the application throws an error.
-   Stripping input: If the input contains dangerous characters, these characters are removed before they are processed.

### OS command Injection
Command Injection occurs when server-side code (like PHP) in a web application makes a system call on the hosting machine.  Sometimes this won't always end in something malicious, like a `whoami` or just reading of files. That isn't too bad. But the thing about command injection is it opens up many options for the attacker. 

The worst thing they could do would be to spawn a reverse shell to become the user that the web server is running as. A simple `;nc -e /bin/bash` is all that's needed and they own your server; some variants of netcat don't support the -e option. You can use a list of [these](http://pentestmonkey.net/cheat-sheet/shells/reverse-shell-cheat-sheet) reverse shells as an alternative.  
## Broken Authentication
  

Authentication and session management constitute core components of modern web applications. Authentication allows users to gain access to web applications by verifying their identities. Attaching session cookies means that the server will know who is sending what data. The server can then keep track of users' actions.
If an attacker is able to find flaws in an authentication mechanism, they would then successfully gain access to other users’ accounts. This would allow the attacker to access sensitive data (depending on the purpose of the application). Some common flaws in authentication mechanisms include:  
  

-   Brute force attacks: If a web application uses usernames and passwords, an attacker is able to launch brute force attacks that allow them to guess the username and passwords using multiple authentication attempts.
-   Use of weak credentials: web applications should set strong password policies. If applications allow users to set passwords such as ‘password1’ or common passwords, then an attacker is able to easily guess them and access user accounts. They can do this without brute forcing and without multiple attempts.
-   Weak Session Cookies: Session cookies are how the server keeps track of users. If session cookies contain predictable values, an attacker can set their own session cookies and access users’ accounts.

There can be various mitigation for broken authentication mechanisms depending on the exact flaw:

-   To avoid password guessing attacks, ensure the application enforces a strong password policy.
-   To avoid brute force attacks, ensure that the application enforces an automatic lockout after a certain number of attempts. This would prevent an attacker from launching more brute force attacks.
-   Implement Multi Factor Authentication - If a user has multiple methods of authentication, for example, using username and passwords and receiving a code on their mobile device, then it would be difficult for an attacker to get access to both credentials to get access to their account.

## Sensitive Data Exposure
When a webapp accidentally divulges sensitive data, we refer to it as "Sensitive Data Exposure". This is often data directly linked to customers (e.g. names, dates-of-birth, financial information, etc), but could also be more technical information, such as usernames and passwords. At more complex levels this often involves techniques such as a "Man in The Middle Attack", whereby the attacker would force user connections through a device which they control, then take advantage of weak encryption on any transmitted data to gain access to the intercepted information (if the data is even encrypted in the first place...).
## XML External entity
An XML External Entity (XXE) attack is a vulnerability that abuses features of XML parsers/data. It often allows an attacker to interact with any backend or external systems that the application itself can access and can allow the attacker to read the file on that system. They can also cause Denial of Service (DoS) attack or could use XXE to perform Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) inducing the web application to make requests to other applications. XXE may even enable port scanning and lead to remote code execution.  
  
There are two types of XXE attacks: in-band and out-of-band (OOB-XXE).  
1) An in-band XXE attack is the one in which the attacker can receive an immediate response to the XXE payload.

2) out-of-band XXE attacks (also called blind XXE), there is no immediate response from the web application and attacker has to reflect the output of their XXE payload to some other file or their own server.

## Broken Acess Control
Access control, sometimes called authorization, is how a web application grants access to content and functions to some users and not others. These checks are performed after authentication, and govern what ‘authorized’ users are allowed to do. Access control sounds like a simple problem but is insidiously difficult to implement correctly. A web application’s access control model is closely tied to the content and functions that the site provides. In addition, the users may fall into a number of groups or roles with different abilities or privileges.

IDOR, or Insecure Direct Object Reference, is the act of exploiting a misconfiguration in the way user input is handled, to access resources you wouldn't ordinarily be able to access. IDOR is a type of access control vulnerability.

For example, let's say we're logging into our bank account, and after correctly authenticating ourselves, we get taken to a URL like this [https://example.com/bank?account_number=1234](https://example.com/bank?account_number=1234). On that page we can see all our important bank details, and a user would do whatever they needed to do and move along their way thinking nothing is wrong. There is however a potentially huge problem here, a hacker may be able to change the account_number parameter to something else like 1235, and if the site is incorrectly configured, then he would have access to someone else's bank information.
## Security Misconfiguration
Security misconfigurations include:
-   Poorly configured permissions on cloud services, like S3 buckets
-   Having unnecessary features enabled, like services, pages, accounts or privileges
-   Default accounts with unchanged passwords
-   Error messages that are overly detailed and allow an attacker to find out more about the system
-   Not using [HTTP security headers](https://owasp.org/www-project-secure-headers/), or revealing too much detail in the Server: HTTP header

## Cross-site Scripting (XSS)
Cross-site scripting, also known as XSS is a security vulnerability typically found in web applications. It’s a type of injection which can allow an attacker to execute malicious scripts and have it execute on a victim’s machine.

  

A web application is vulnerable to XSS if it uses unsanitized user input. XSS is possible in Javascript, VBScript, Flash and CSS. There are three main types of cross-site scripting:

1.  Stored XSS - the most dangerous type of XSS. This is where a malicious string originates from the website’s database. This often happens when a website allows user input that is not sanitised (remove the "bad parts" of a users input) when inserted into the database.
2.  Reflected XSS - the malicious payload is part of the victims request to the website. The website includes this payload in response back to the user. To summarise, an attacker needs to trick a victim into clicking a URL to execute their malicious payload.
3.  DOM-Based XSS - DOM stands for Document Object Model and is a programming interface for HTML and XML documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style and content. A web page is a document and this document can be either displayed in the browser window or as the HTML source.

Remember, cross-site scripting is a vulnerability that can be exploited to execute malicious Javascript on a victim’s machine. Check out some common payloads types used:

-   Popup's (`<script>alert(“Hello World”)</script>`) - Creates a Hello World message popup on a users browser.
-   Writing HTML (document.write) - Override the website's HTML to add your own (essentially defacing the entire page).
-   XSS Keylogger (http://www.xss-payloads.com/payloads/scripts/simplekeylogger.js.html) - You can log all keystrokes of a user, capturing their password and other sensitive information they type into the webpage.
-   Port scanning (http://www.xss-payloads.com/payloads/scripts/portscanapi.js.html) - A mini local port scanner

XSS-Payloads.com (http://www.xss-payloads.com/) is a website that has XSS related Payloads, Tools, Documentation and more. You can download XSS payloads that take snapshots from a webcam or even get a more capable port and network scanner.

## Insecure Deserialisation
This definition is still quite broad to say the least. Simply, insecure deserialization is replacing data processed by an application with malicious code; allowing anything from DoS (Denial of Service) to RCE (Remote Code Execution) that the attacker can use to gain a foothold in a pentesting scenario.

Specifically, this malicious code leverages the legitimate serialization and deserialization process used by web applications.
- Low exploitability. This vulnerability is often a case-by-case basis - there is no reliable tool/framework for it. Because of its nature, attackers need to have a good understanding of the inner-workings of the ToE.

- The exploit is only as dangerous as the attacker's skill permits, more so, the value of the data that is exposed. For example, someone who can only cause a DoS will make the application unavailable. The business impact of this will vary on the infrastructure - some organisations will recover just fine, others, however, will not.

**Serialisation** is the process of converting objects used in programming into simpler, compatible formatting for transmitting between systems or networks for further processing or storage. Alternatively, **deserialisation** is the reverse of this; converting serialised information into their complex form - an object that the application will understand.

## Components With Known Vulnerabilities
Occasionally, you may find that the company/entity that you're pen-testing is using a program that already has a well documented vulnerability.

For example, let's say that a company hasn't updated their version of WordPress for a few years, and using a tool such as wpscan, you find that it's version 4.6. Some quick research will reveal that WordPress 4.6 is vulnerable to an unauthenticated remote code execution(RCE) exploit, and even better you can find an exploit already made on [exploit-db](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/41962).

As you can see this would be quite devastating, because it requires very little work on the part of the attacker as often times since the vulnerability is already well known, someone else has made an exploit for the vulnerability. The situation becomes even worse when you realize, that it's really quite easy for this to happen, if a company misses a single update for a program they use, they could be vulnerable to any number of attacks.

Hence, why OWASP has rated this a 3(meaning high) on the prevalence scale, it is incredibly easy for a company to miss an update for an application.
## Insufficient Logging and Monitoring
When web applications are set up, every action performed by the user should be logged. Logging is important because in the event of an incident, the attackers actions can be traced. Once their actions are traced, their risk and impact can be determined. Without logging, there would be no way to tell what actions an attacker performed if they gain access to particular web applications. The bigger impacts of these include:

-   regulatory damage: if an attacker has gained access to personally identifiable user information and there is no record of this, not only are users of the application affected, but the application owners may be subject to fines or more severe actions depending on regulations.
-   risk of further attacks: without logging, the presence of an attacker may be undetected. This could allow an attacker to launch further attacks against web application owners by stealing credentials, attacking infrastructure and more.

The information stored in logs should include:

-   HTTP status codes
-   Time Stamps
-   Usernames
-   API endpoints/page locations
-   IP addresses

These logs do have some sensitive information on them so its important to ensure that logs are stored securely and multiple copies of these logs are stored at different locations.
