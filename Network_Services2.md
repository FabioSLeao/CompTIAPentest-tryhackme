# Network Services 2
## Network File System (NFS)
NFS stands for "Network File System" and allows a system to share directories and files with others over a network. By using NFS, users and programs can access files on remote systems almost as if they were local files. It does this by mounting all, or a portion of a file system on a server. The portion of the file system that is mounted can be accessed by clients with whatever privileges are assigned to each file.

First, the client will request to mount a directory from a remote host on a local directory just the same way it can mount a physical device. The mount service will then act to connect to the relevant mount daemon using RPC.

The server checks if the user has permission to mount whatever directory has been requested. It will then return a file handle which uniquely identifies each file and directory that is on the server.
If someone wants to access a file using NFS, an RPC call is placed to NFSD (the NFS daemon) on the server. This call takes parameters such as:

-   The file handle
-   The name of the file to be accessed
-   The user's, user ID
-   The user's group ID

A computer running Windows Server can act as an NFS file server for other non-Windows client computers. Likewise, NFS allows a Windows-based computer running Windows Server to access files stored on a non-Windows NFS server.
### Privilege Escalation
This sounds complicated, but really- provided you're familiar with how SUID files work, it's fairly easy to understand. We're able to upload files to the NFS share, and control the permissions of these files. We can set the permissions of whatever we upload, in this case a bash shell executable. We can then log in through SSH, as we did in the previous task- and execute this executable to gain a root shell!
## Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)
SMTP stands for "Simple Mail Transfer Protocol". It is utilised to handle the sending of emails. In order to support email services, a protocol pair is required, comprising of SMTP and POP/IMAP. Together they allow the user to send outgoing mail and retrieve incoming mail, respectively.
The SMTP server performs three basic functions:

-   It verifies who is sending emails through the SMTP server.
-   It sends the outgoing mail
-   If the outgoing mail can't be delivered it sends the message back to the sender

Most people will have encountered SMTP when configuring a new email address on some third-party email clients, such as Thunderbird; as when you configure a new email client, you will need to configure the SMTP server configuration in order to send outgoing emails.
## MySQL
MySQL is just a brand name for one of the most popular RDBMS software implementations. As we know, it uses a client-server model. But how does the client and server communicate? They use a language, specifically the Structured Query Language (SQL).  
Many other products, such as PostgreSQL and Microsoft SQL server have the word SQL in them. This similarly signifies that this is a product utilising the Structured Query Language syntax.
MySQL, as an RDBMS, is made up of the server and utility programs that help in the administration of mySQL databases.

The server handles all database instructions like creating editing and accessing data. It takes, and manages these requests and communicates using the MySQL protocol. This whole process can be broken down into these stages:  

1.  MySQL creates a database for storing and manipulating data, defining the relationship of each table.
2.  Clients make requests by making specific statements in SQL.
3.  The server will respond to the client with whatever information has been requested
